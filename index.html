        2019
        The first-person shooter video game was developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. Serving as the sixteenth
        overall installment in the Call of Duty series, as well as a reboot of the Modern Warfare sub-series,

    <h2> About the Game </h2>
    <p>The game takes place in a realistic and modern setting. The campaign follows a CIA officer and British SAS forces
        as they team up with rebels from the fictional Republic of Urzikstan,
        combating together against the Russian Armed Forces who have invaded the country and the Urzik terrorist group
        Al-Qatala while searching for a stolen shipment of chlorine gas.</p>

    <p><b>It has Four Modes</b></p>
    <ul>

        <li> <b>Campaign:</b>Modern Warfare's single-player campaign focuses on realism and features tactically-based
            moral choices whereupon the player is evaluated and assigned a score at the end of each level</li>
        <br>
        <li> <b>Multiplayer:</b>Modern Warfare's multiplayer has been revised from its predecessors to allow for a more
            tactical gameplay style, including a focus on map exploration, door breaching, and a Hardcore "Realism" mode
            that removes the HUD. The mini-map was originally removed in favor of a compass-style marker, with visual
            cues to detect friendlies and opponents. </li>
        <br>
        <li> <b>Special Ops:</b>Modern Warfare is the first game in the series since 2013's Call of Duty: Ghosts not to
            feature a Zombies mode, instead of featuring the cooperative "Special Ops" mode previously present in Call
            of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Spec Ops shares its narrative with both
            the campaign and multiplayer. It includes a "Survival" mode, which was a timed exclusive to the
            PlayStation 4 release until October 2020. At launch, Special Ops features four Operations, which are
            multi-objective missions that take place on a large open map requiring mandatory 4-player cooperation; and
            Classic Special Ops features smaller-scale missions that are similar to the original Spec Ops mode.</li>
        <br>
        <li> <b>Warzone:</b>Modern Warfare includes a battle royale game mode called Warzone, introduced during Season
            2. The mode features 150 players, battling either in teams of four, three, two, or solo. Warzone is released
            as a free standalone game which can be downloaded independently. The map combines several locations
            that are featured prominently in Multiplayer and Special Ops modes. Weapon balancing is maintained with parity to
            Multiplayer modes, with the exception of higher headshot damage to reward aiming.</li>
